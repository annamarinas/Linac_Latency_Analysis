Notes up front:

- this is just a collection of initial ideas for how the project might be implemented technically
- of course, I don’t yet know whether the code will actually work because we don’t know the exact oscilloscope model yet, and haven’t tested with real data
- however, the simulation using test data worked well, so the basic logic seems solid
- I thought having a rough structure like this might help as a starting point for the project, so we can build on it together later



What does the code do?

- this script is meant to analyse signals from a LINAC and determine the exact moment when the radiation beam turns off and the LINAC system shuts down
- it then compares these two times and calculates the delay (Δt) between them



Step-by-step explanation:
 

1. Setup and configuration:
-> which channels the oscilloscope will use to read the beam signal (CH1) and system signal (CH2)
-> how many data points we want to collect (2500, random number atm)
-> the voltage threshold (2.5 V, random number atm) used to detect when a signal drops and something turns off


2. Detect the shutoff time
-> the code looks through each signal and finds the first moment when the voltage drops below 2.5 volts
-> this moment is called the falling edge
-> the code records the timestamp (in microseconds, random unit atm) when the beam turns off and when the system turns off


3. Calculate the time difference
-> it subtracts the two times to find how long after the beam shut off the system shut down
-> this delay (Δt) is shown in microseconds (again, random unit atm)


4. Plot the results
-> it creates a graph showing both signals over time
-> it marks the moment each signal drops (beam-off and system-off) with a dashed vertical line
-> the graph helps visualize the timing and verify that the delay is correct
